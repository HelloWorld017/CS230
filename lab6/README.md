# LAB 6: Malloc Lab


## 1. Introduction
In this lab you will be writing a dynamic storage allocator for C
programs, i.e., your own version of the `malloc`, `free` and
`realloc` routines. You are encouraged to explore the design space
creatively and implement an allocator that is correct, efficient and
fast.

***********************************************************
## 2. Logistics
You will work by yourself for the Malloc Lab. We will be checking for cheating, copying, etc. ___Please try to solve this lab on your own.___ You are free to use the code in the text book (make sure you understand the code!). However, to get higher points, you will need to implement more advanced allocator techniques discussed in the slides/textbook such as `explicit free list` and `segregated free lists`.

Any clarifications and revisions to the assignments will be posted on Piazza.

***********************************************************
## 3. Hand Out Instructions
First make sure you fork the `CS230/LAB6` repository to your **private** namespace! 
If you don't, you won't be able to submit your work.
Once you have your private repo, you may clone your private repo.
Also, make sure you have added your SSH key to the GitLab Web UI.
To check SSH key settings and how to fork and clone, please see previous
announcements and Lab 1 `README`.
```
unix> git clone ssh://git@cs230.kaist.ac.kr:10022/cs[your_student_id]/lab6.git
```

The only file you will be
modifying and handing in is `mm.c`.  The `mdriver.c` program
is a driver program that allows you to evaluate the performance of
your solution. Use the command `make` to generate the driver code
and run it with the command `./mdriver -V`. (The `-V` flag
displays helpful summary information.)

***********************************************************
## 4. How to Work on the Lab
Your dynamic storage allocator will consist of the following four
functions, which are declared in `mm.h` and defined in
`mm.c`.

```
    int   mm_init(void);
    void *mm_malloc(size_t size);
    void  mm_free(void *ptr);
    void *mm_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
```

The `mm.c` file we have given you implements the simplest but
still functionally correct malloc package that we could think
of. Using this as a starting place, modify these functions (and
possibly define other private `static` functions), so that they
obey the following semantics:

- `mm_init`: Before calling `mm_malloc` `mm_realloc` or `mm_free`, the application program (i.e., the
trace-driven driver program that you will use to evaluate your
implementation) calls `mm_init` to perform any necessary
initializations, such as allocating the initial heap area.
The return value should be -1 if there was a problem in performing the
initialization, 0 otherwise.
  
- `mm_malloc`: The `mm_malloc` routine returns a pointer
to an allocated block payload of at least `size` bytes.  The
entire allocated block should lie within the heap region and should
not overlap with any other allocated chunk.

  We will comparing your implementation to the version of `malloc`
supplied in the standard C library (`libc`). Since the 
`libc` malloc always returns payload pointers that are 
aligned to 8 bytes, your malloc implementation should do likewise
and always return 8-byte aligned pointers.
  
- `mm_free`: The `mm_free` routine frees the block
pointed to by `ptr`.  It returns nothing. This routine is only
guaranteed to work when the passed pointer (`ptr`) was returned by
an earlier call to `mm_malloc` or `mm_realloc` and has not
yet been freed.

- `mm_realloc`: The `mm_realloc` routine returns a pointer
to an allocated region of at least `size` bytes  with the following 
constraints. 

  - if `ptr` is NULL, the call is equivalent to {\tt mm\_malloc(size)}; 

  - if `size` is equal to zero, the call is equivalent to 
`mm_free`;

  - if `ptr` is not NULL, it must have been returned by an
earlier call to `mm_malloc` or `mm_realloc`. The call to
`mm_realloc` changes the size of the memory block pointed to by
`ptr` (the *old block*) to `size` bytes and returns the
address of the new block. Notice that the address of the new block
might be the same as the old block, or it might be different,
depending on your implementation, the amount of internal fragmentation
in the old block, and the size of the `realloc` request.

    The contents of the new block are the same as those of the old {\tt
ptr} block, up to the minimum of the old and new sizes. Everything
else is uninitialized. For example, if the old block is 8 bytes and
the new block is 12 bytes, then the first 8 bytes of the new block
are identical to the first 8 bytes of the old block and the last 4
bytes are uninitialized.  Similarly, if the old block is 8 bytes and
the new block is 4 bytes, then the contents of the new block are
identical to the first 4 bytes of the old block.

These semantics match the the semantics of the corresponding
*libc* `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free` routines.
Type `man malloc` to the shell for complete documentation.

***********************************************************
## 5. Heap Consistency Checker

Dynamic memory allocators are notoriously tricky beasts to program
correctly and efficiently. They are difficult to program correctly
because they involve a lot of untyped pointer manipulation.  You will
find it very helpful to write a heap checker that scans the heap and
checks it for consistency.

Some examples of what a heap checker might check are:
- Is every block in the free list marked as free?
- Are there any contiguous free blocks that somehow escaped
coalescing?
- Is every free block actually in the free list?
- Do the pointers in the free list point to valid free blocks?
- Do any allocated blocks overlap?
- Do the pointers in a heap block point to valid heap
addresses?

Your heap checker will consist of the function `int mm_check(void)` in `mm.c`.  It will check any invariants or consistency conditions you consider prudent.  It returns a nonzero value if and only if your heap is consistent.  You are not limited to the listed suggestions nor are you required to check all of them.  You are encouraged to print out error messages when `mm_check` fails.

This consistency checker is for your own debugging during development. When you submit `mm.c`, make sure to remove any calls to `mm_check` as they will slow down your throughput.


***********************************************************
## 6. Support Routines
The `memlib.c` package simulates the memory system for your
dynamic memory allocator. You can invoke the following functions
in `memlib.c`:

- `void *mem_sbrk(int incr)`:   
Expands the heap by `incr` bytes, where `incr` is a positive
non-zero integer and returns a generic pointer to the first byte of
the newly allocated heap area. The semantics are identical to the Unix
`sbrk` function, except that `mem_sbrk` accepts only a
positive non-zero integer argument.

- `void *mem_heap_lo(void)`:
Returns a generic pointer to the first byte in the heap.

- `void *mem_heap_hi(void)`:
Returns a generic pointer to the last byte in the heap.

- `size_t mem_heapsize(void)`:
Returns the current size of the heap in bytes.

- `size_t mem_pagesize(void)`:
Returns the system's page size in bytes (4K on Linux systems).


***********************************************************
## 7. The Trace-driven Driver Program

The driver program `mdriver.c` distribution tests your
 `mm.c` package for correctness, space
utilization, and throughput. The driver program is controlled by a set
of `trace files`. Each trace file contains a
sequence of allocate, reallocate, and free directions that instruct
the driver to call your `mm_malloc`, `mm_realloc`, and `mm_free` routines in some sequence. The driver and the trace files
are the same ones we will use when we grade your handin `mm.c`
file.

The driver `mdriver.c` accepts the following command line arguments:

- `-t <tracedir>`: 
Look for the default trace files in directory `tracedir` 
instead of the default directory defined in `config.h`.

- `-f <tracefile>`: 
Use one particular `tracefile` for testing instead of the 
default set of tracefiles.

- `-h`:
Print a summary of the command line arguments.

- `-l`:
Run and measure `libc` malloc in addition to the student's malloc package.

- `-v`:
Verbose output. Print a performance breakdown for each tracefile
in a compact table.

- `-V}`: 
More verbose output. Prints additional diagnostic information as each
trace file is processed.  Useful during debugging for determining
which trace file is causing your malloc package to fail.

***********************************************************
## 8. Programming Rules

- You should not change any of the interfaces in `mm.c`.

- You should not invoke any memory-management related library
calls or system calls.  This excludes the use of `malloc`, `calloc`, `free`, `realloc`, `sbrk`, `brk` or any
variants of these calls in your code.

- You are not allowed to define any global or `static` compound data
structures such as arrays, structs, trees, or lists in your `mm.c`
program.  However, you `are` allowed to declare global scalar variables
such as integers, floats, and pointers in `mm.c`. 

- For consistency with the `libc malloc` package, which
returns blocks aligned on 8-byte boundaries, your allocator must
always return pointers that are aligned to 8-byte boundaries.  The
driver will enforce this requirement for you.

***********************************************************
## 9. Evaluation

You will receive **zero points** if you break any of the rules or
your code is buggy and crashes the driver.  Otherwise, your grade will
be calculated as follows:

- ___Correctness (11 points).___ You will receive full points if your
solution passes the correctness tests performed by the driver program.
You will receive partial credit for each correct trace.

- ___Performance (100 points).___  Two performance metrics will be used
to evaluate your solution:

  - *Space utilization*: The peak ratio between the aggregate
amount of memory used by the driver (i.e., allocated via
`mm_malloc` or `mm_realloc` but not yet freed via
`mm_free`) and the size of the heap used by your allocator. The
optimal ratio equals to 1.  You should find good policies to minimize
fragmentation in order to make this ratio as close as possible to the
optimal.

  - *Throughput*: The average number of operations completed per second.
The driver program summarizes the performance of your
allocator by computing a *performance index*, $`P`$, which is a
weighted sum of the space utilization and throughput, $`P = w{U} + (1-w) \min\left(1, \frac{T}{T_{libc}}\right)`$
, where $`U`$ is your space utilization, $`T`$ is your throughput, and
$`T_{libc}`$ is the estimated throughput of `libc` malloc on your
system on the default traces.   
    * The value for $`T_{libc}`$ is a
constant in the driver (600 Kops/s) that your instructor established
when they configured the program. The performance index favors space utilization over throughput, with a
default of $`w = 0.6`$.   
    * Observing that both memory and CPU cycles are expensive system
resources, we adopt this formula to encourage balanced optimization of
both memory utilization and throughput.
Ideally, the performance index will reach $`P = w + (1-w) = 1`$ or $`100\%`$.  Since each
metric will contribute at most $w$ and $`1-w`$ to the performance index,
respectively, you should not go to extremes to optimize either the
memory utilization or the throughput only. To receive a good score,
you must achieve a balance between utilization and throughput.      

- ___Final Score (55 points).___ Final score will be weighted sum of ___Correctness___ and ___Performance___.
```math
your score = correct * \frac{20}{11} + perf * \frac{35}{100}
```

## 10. Hand In Instructions

Once you have finished your implementation and your test cases have passed, you 
can submit your code. Its similar to what you have done in Lab 5. Make sure that 
you add the `mm.c` file, and commit your changes. You can do so with the 
following commands

    unix> git add mm.c
    unix> git commit -m "Your commit message"

First command adds `mm.c` to your next commit. Then, you can commit it by typing 
commit command. Execute following command to make sure that you do not have any 
uncommitted changes to the `mm.c` file.

    unix> get status

To hand in your lab, execute the following command

    unix> make handin

This step will push your local commits onto your GitLab remote repository. Make
sure that your remote repository is your forked version of the Lab 6. Your
remote URL should be something like 
`ssh://git@cs230.kaist.ac.kr:10022/[Your_user_name]/lab6.git`. You can 
check your remote URL using the following command: 

    unix> git remote -v

Check the tags section in the GitLab Web interface to see if your latest code 
has been pushed onto the server. The URL to check your tags is
`https://cs230.kaist.ac.kr:10022/[Your_user_name]/lab6/tags`. Same as 
previous lab, if you can see the tag on GitLab, your submission is successfully uploaded.

## 11. Hints

- *Use the `mdriver -f` option.*  During initial
development, using tiny trace files will simplify debugging and
testing. We have included two such trace files (`short{1,2}-bal.rep`) that you can use for initial debugging.

- *Use the `mdriver -v` and `-V` options.*  The
`-v` option will give you a detailed summary for each trace file.
The `-V` will also indicate when each trace file is read, which 
will help you isolate errors.

- *Compile with `gcc -g` and use a debugger.* A debugger
will help you isolate and identify out of bounds memory references.

- *Understand every line of the malloc implementation in the
textbook.*  The textbook has a detailed example of a simple allocator
based on an implicit free list. Use this is a point of departure.
Don't start working on your allocator until you understand everything
about the simple implicit list allocator.

- *Encapsulate your pointer arithmetic in C preprocessor
macros.*  Pointer arithmetic in memory managers is confusing and error-prone
because of all the casting that is necessary. You can reduce the
complexity significantly by writing macros for your pointer operations.
See the text for examples. 

- *Do your implementation in stages.*  The first 9 traces
contain requests to `malloc` and `free`.  The last 2 traces
contain requests for `realloc`, `malloc`, and `free`. We
recommend that you start by getting your `malloc` and `free`
routines working correctly and efficiently on the first 9 traces. Only
then should you turn your attention to the `realloc`
implementation.  For starters, build `realloc` on top of your
existing `malloc` and `free` implementations. But to get
really good performance, you will need to build a stand-alone `realloc`.

- *Use a profiler.* You may find the `gprof` tool helpful
for optimizing performance.

- ___Start early!___ It is possible to write an efficient malloc
package with a few pages of code. However, we can guarantee that it
will be some of the most difficult and sophisticated code you have
written so far in your career. So start early, and good luck!
